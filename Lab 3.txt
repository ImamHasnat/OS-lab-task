Take user input for N characters in an array and only output the vowels from those characters.

Create an array to store five integer numbers by asking the user for the inputs. Now, develop a program that checks whether each number present in the array is an even number or an odd number and replaces the even numbers with a '0' and odd numbers with a '1'. Later, the program prints the modified array.

Read stored student ID from a file and split the ID into three separate information: Year, Unique ID, and Semester.

#!/bin/bash

# Task 1: Extract vowels from user input
echo "Enter characters:"
read input
echo "Vowels in input:"
echo "$input" | grep -o -i '[aeiou]'

echo "----------------------"

# Task 2: Replace even numbers with '0' and odd numbers with '1'
echo "Enter 5 numbers separated by space:"
read -a arr
echo "Modified array:"
echo "${arr[@]}" | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) printf ($i%2==0 ? "0 " : "1 ")}'
echo

echo "----------------------"

# Task 3: Extract Year, Unique ID, and Semester from Student ID
echo "Enter student ID (e.g., 2312345Spring):"
read id
year=$(echo "$id" | grep -o '^[0-9]\{2\}')
unique_id=$(echo "$id" | grep -o '[0-9]\{5\}')
semester=$(echo "$id" | grep -o '[A-Za-z]*$')

echo "Year: $year"
echo "Unique ID: $unique_id"
echo "Semester: $semester"
