1. If the buying price and selling price of an item is taken as user input, write a program to determine whether the seller has made a profit or incurred a loss.
Also, determine how much profit he made or the loss he incurred. (Using If-else)
3. Take any 3 integer numbers.
Write a program to find out the smallest number among 3 numbers. (Using If-else)


Solution-----



#!/bin/bash

# Take user input for buying price and selling price
echo "Enter the buying price of the item:"
read buying_price
echo "Enter the selling price of the item:"
read selling_price

# Calculate profit or loss
if [ $selling_price -gt $buying_price ]; then
    profit=$((selling_price - buying_price))
    echo "The seller made a profit of $profit."
elif [ $selling_price -lt $buying_price ]; then
    loss=$((buying_price - selling_price))
    echo "The seller incurred a loss of $loss."
else
    echo "No profit, no loss."
fi





#!/bin/bash

# Take user input for three integers
echo "Enter the first number:"
read num1
echo "Enter the second number:"
read num2
echo "Enter the third number:"
read num3

# Find the smallest number
if [ $num1 -le $num2 ] && [ $num1 -le $num3 ]; then
    echo "The smallest number is $num1."
elif [ $num2 -le $num1 ] && [ $num2 -le $num3 ]; then
    echo "The smallest number is $num2."
else
    echo "The smallest number is $num3."
fi
